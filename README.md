# 4 reasons why the Kanade Yoisaki Kanji tag (宵崎奏) should exist: a text written by Obsidian

## 1. Her popularity
    Kanade is highly popular. Almost everyone that knows Nightcord at 25:00 knows Kanade, even when they can only describe her as "the girl with white hair from Nightcord"; that's still Kanade. 

## 2. High demand
    This ties in to reason number 1, that being Kanade is highly popular among Nightcord at 25:00 fans. Her popularity increases demand for the Kanade guild tag, and with the lack of supply (ties into reason 3), could in turn boost the popularity of the new server, if it's equipped with the Kanade Yoisaki kanji tag. 

## 3. Exists, but as a private guild
    The guild tag may already exist, yes, but the problem lies in it being a private guild. The fact that it is a private guild in and of itself may make it difficult for users to access, since the server owner reserves the right to not allow some users into their server just for the tag.

## 4. Summary
    In summary, the Kanade guild tag may increase the popularity for the new server because of Kanade's popularity among Nightcord at 25:00 fans and the lack of supply for the Kanade kanji tag due to the existing server being private.
